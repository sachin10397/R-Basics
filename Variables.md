# Getting Started
To define a variable, we may use the assignment symbol “<-“.
There are two ways to see the value stored in variable: (1) type the variable into the console and hit Return, or (2) type print(“variable name”) and hit Return.
Objects are stuff that is stored in R.  They can be variables, functions, etc.
The ls() function shows the names of the objects that are saved in your workspace.
