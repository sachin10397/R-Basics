#  R, arithmetic operations on vectors occur element-wise
Code
# The name of the state with the maximum population is found by doing the following
murders$state[which.max(murders$population)]
# how to obtain the murder rate
murder_rate <- murders$total / murders$population * 100000
# ordering the states by murder rate, in decreasing order
murders$state[order(murder_rate, decreasing=TRUE)]

# defining murder rate as before
murder_rate <- murders$total / murders$population * 100000
# creating a logical vector that specifies if the murder rate in that state is less than or equal to 0.71
index <- murder_rate <= 0.71
# determining which states have murder rates less than or equal to 0.71
murders$state[index]
# calculating how many states have a murder rate less than or equal to 0.71
sum(index)

# creating the two logical vectors representing our conditions
west <- murders$region == "West"
safe <- murder_rate <= 1
# defining an index and identifying states with both conditions true
index <- safe & west
murders$state[index]
