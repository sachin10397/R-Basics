The R function, called function() tells R you are about to define a new function.
Functions are objects, so must be assigned a variable name with the arrow operator.
The general way to define functions is: (1) decide the function name, which will be an object, (2) type function() with your function's arguments in parentheses, (3) write all the operations inside brackets.
Variables defined inside a function are not saved in the workspace.
