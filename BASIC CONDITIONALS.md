The most common conditional expression in programming is an if-else statement, which has the form "if [condition], perform [expression], else perform [alternative expression]".
The ifelse() function works similarly to an if-else statement, but it is particularly useful since it works on vectors by examining each element of the vector and returning a corresponding answer accordingly.
The any() function takes a vector of logicals and returns true if any of the entries are true.
The all() function takes a vector of logicals and returns true if all of the entries are true.
