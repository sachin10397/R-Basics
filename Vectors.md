The function c(), which stands for concatenate, is useful for creating vectors.
Another useful function for creating vectors is the seq() function, which generates sequences.
Subsetting lets us access specific parts of a vector by using square brackets to access elements of a vector.

 We can use logicals to index vectors.
. Using the function >sum()on a logical vector returns the number of entries that are true.
. The logical operator “&” makes two logicals true only when they are both true.
