 To change a data table by adding a new column, or changing an existing one, we use the mutate function.
To filter the data by subsetting rows, we use the function filter.
To subset the data by selecting specific columns, we use the select function.
We can perform a series of operations by sending the results of one function to another function using what is called the pipe operator, %>%.
