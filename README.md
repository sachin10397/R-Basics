We can create a simple scatterplot using the function plot().
Histograms are graphical summaries that give you a general overview of the types of values you have.  In R, they can be produced using the hist() function.
Boxplots provide a more compact summary of a distribution than a histogram and are more useful for comparing distributions. They can be produced using the boxplot() function.
