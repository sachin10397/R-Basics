 In general, to evaluate a function we need to use parentheses. If we type a function without parenthesis, R shows us the code for the function. Most functions also require an argument, that is, something to be written inside the parenthesis.
. To access help files, we may use the help function help(“function name”), or write the question mark followed by the function name.
. The help file shows you the arguments the function is expecting, some of which are required and some are optional. If an argument is optional, a default value is assigned with the equal sign. The args() function also shows the arguments a function needs.
. To specify arguments, we use the equals sign. If no argument name is used, R assumes you’re entering arguments in the order shown in the help file.
. Creating and saving a script makes code much easier to execute.
. To make your code more readable, use intuitive variable names and include comments (using the “#” symbol) to remind yourself why you wrote a particular line of code.
