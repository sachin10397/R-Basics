In general, coercion is an attempt by R to be flexible with data types by guessing what was meant when an entry does not match the expected. For example, when defining x as
>x <- c(1, "canada", 3)

R coerced the data into characters. It guessed that because you put a character string in the vector, you meant the 1 and 3 to actually be character strings "1" and “3”.

The functionas.character() turns numbers into characters.
The function as.numeric() turns characters into numbers.
In R, missing data is assigned the value NA.
