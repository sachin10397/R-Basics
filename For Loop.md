 For-loops perform the same task over and over while changing the variable.  They let us define the range that our variable takes, and then changes the value with each loop and evaluates the expression every time inside the loop.
The general form of a for-loop is: "For i in [some range], do operations".  This i changes across the range of values and the operations assume i is a value you're interested in computing on.
At the end of the loop, the value of i is the last value of the range.
